# AI Prototyping Workspace

Rapid HTML/CSS prototyping powered by AI agents (GitLab Duo, Copilot, Claude, Gemini).
Prototypes use **Tailwind CSS**, **Flowbite components**, and shared **design tokens** for consistent styling.

---

## Quick Start

1. **Clone this repo** from GitLab onto your local machine.
2. **Copy the template folder:**
   - Navigate to `/prototypes/template/`
   - Copy the entire folder and rename it to your project name (e.g., `/prototypes/checkout-redesign/`)
3. **Open your new folder** in your editor (VS Code, WebStorm, etc.).
4. **Start prompting your AI agent** with something like:

   > "Using Tailwind, Flowbite, and the design tokens in `/design-system/`, build the initial layout for my checkout redesign."

5. **Preview your work** by opening `index.html` in a browser (no build step required).
